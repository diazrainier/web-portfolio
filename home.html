	<!-- This is about myself -->
	<p class="about">I'm a Full Stack Web Developer currently residing in the Philippines. I have serious passion for making UI Interface Designs as well as Front-end to back-end web developing. I also currently hold a National Certificate on Visual Graphic Design thus making me a graphic artist as well. With the mentioned set of skills, I can make Web Interface Designs a lot more creative and professional at the same time.</p>
